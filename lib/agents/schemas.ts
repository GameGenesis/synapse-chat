When creating the taskList, keep the following guidelines in mind:
   - Only choose agents that are relevant to the task.
   - Stay within the scope of the described project.
   - You may assign multiple tasks to the same agent if required (for different tasks or as different personas).
   - Preferably, do not assign the same agent to two consecutive related tasks, as those should be grouped, unless they involve multiple personas or fields.
   - Keep in mind that final results should be formatted in markdown, plaintext, LaTeX, or as code. You do not need to delegate this formatting as a separate task.
